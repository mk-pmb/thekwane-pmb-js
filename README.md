Helps me filter and sort my email.

I used to have Mozilla Thunderbird do it, but increasingly often it flinches
from acting upon my rules, claiming lots of mail wouldn't match my search
criteria when I'm pretty sure they do.

Additionally, managing rules accross profiles and computers was becoming
tedious, so it's time for the Thekwane (lightning bird) to step in.
